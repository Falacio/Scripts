# Scripts

Simple script to resume only Harvester/farmer info from debug.log



Execute Resumen_log.py in python3, or Resume_log.exe

It will create a new file: C:\Users\UserName\\.chia\mainnet\log\farm_debug.log wich contains only entries from harvester or farmer

Each time the script/program is run, a new file will be created, overwriting old one
