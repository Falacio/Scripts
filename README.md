# Scripts

Simple script to resume only Harvester/farmer info from debug.log

First of all , you shold set your logging level to INFO in your config.yaml (restart is requiered for change to have effect)

Execute Resumen_log.py in python3, or Resume_log.exe\n
It will create a new file: C:\Users\UserName\\.chia\mainnet\log\farm_debug.log\n 
  wich contains only entries from harvester or farmer\n
Each time the script/program is run, a new file will be created, overwriting old one\n
